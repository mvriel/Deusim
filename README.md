Deusim
======

Experimental ventures in self-learning applications using PHP.

Introduction
------------

Deusim stands for 'Deus in Machina', which is latin for 'God in the Machine'.
This project is a personal experimental venture in the world of self-learning 
applications. I have no experience or education in this field (which should 
make any chance for success negligible); but I do have some theories on possible 
angles.

Goals
-----

The goals for this project are very simple:

- Learning by experimenting, by experimenting with the technology I get familiarity with it
- Expanding work on Cilex, by using this application I hope to be able to expand on Cilex
- Learning MongoDB, in these early stages I am going to use Mongo as 'memory' for the the learning application. This will help me gain understanding.

And more that I haven't even mentioned yet
