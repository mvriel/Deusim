Deusim is a venture into self-learning applications.

Theory
------

With Deusim I intend to step away from the existing paved path of
fuzzy logic, neural networks and other existing adaptive technologies.

This project revolves around identifying how to abstract the process of
intelligence and cognitive capabilities.

The first step is to acknowledge that intelligence is a matter of 
collecting and correlating data. By correlating that data new possibilities
may arise that might have previously been unavailable.

Collecting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a self-learning application has to collect data it is limited to the 
'senses' that it has. It is nigh impossible to teach an application what an
apple is if it has no way of experiencing all properties of the object.

.. important::

   The same goes for organic beings: a person that has been blind from birth 
   will never be able to have the same level of engagement and bewilderment
   of a beautiful visual scene as does someone who has (had) sight.

Acknowledging that the SLA (self learning application) has no conventional
senses is the first step in being able to design a learning system.

As such a SLA needs to be pre-programmed with a set of senses with which it
may discover the outside (digital) world.

.. note::

   Human physiology comes pre-equipped with senses such as sight, hearing, touch, 
   smell and taste. A human does not need to learn how to experience sensations
   but is able to do that and analyze any data coming from those senses without
   having been taught.

*Summary*: Collecting data is separated into 2 areas: experiencing sensations 
and analyzing their properties.
